#What is programming?

- The act/process of converting a solution to a problem into a set machine readable instructions
- Tools of the trade include:
  - The machine/computer that will accept the input and produce the output
  - The programming language which is the medium through which we commuicate instructions to the computer. Comes in multiple flavors: compiled vs interpreted, static vs dynamic. Some examples are Java, Clojure, Ruby, C#, Python, and off course [F#](http://fsharp.org/)

#What is F#

- A programming language from the ML family of languages
- Statically typed
- Type Inference
- Runs on .NET
- Functional language

#Why F#

- Type safety
- Concice
- Reportedly easier to learn 

#Types

- Numeric types : Integer, floating points, etc...
- String (text)
- Collections (arrays, lists, tuples)
- Booleans (true/false)
- etc..

* Everyone has machine setup?*

## Numbers

- Examples: 0, 1, 2, 1.2
- Operations include division, multiplication, addition, substraction, modulo
